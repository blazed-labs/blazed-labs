## Introduction
Of all the ways to raise funds, bonds are the most predictable, stable, and reliable. Any company in the Blazed Nation may issue a bond, so long as the company has maintained a positive credit history.

## Scope
These procedures are to be used by Blazed National Citizens who own, or hold an executive role in a Blazed Nation recognized business.

## Process
1. The company must hire an investment bank to underwrite the bond issue.
2. Once an investment bank is selected, they will draft up the bond contract.
3. The investment bank should contact a rating agency to rate the bond issue.
4. The investment bank will be required to report the bond issue to the Office of Finance, before it can begin.
5. Bond notes are offered for sale to investors.

## Follow-Up Obligations
1. The company must pay the amount of the principle (listed on each purchased note), plus interest accrued in the period of the bond's lifespan to the active holder of the note, at the time of its maturity.

## Notice of Default
In the event that the company cannot reasonably raise the funds required to pay outstanding notes upon maturity, the investor shall be protected and compensated by the investment bank that underwrote the bond issue. In the unlikely event that this investment bank also cannot reasonably raise the funds required to pay outstanding notes upon maturity, then the Woodrow Central Banking Authority will be responsible for compensating the outstanding investor(s) by the maturity date. In such an event of default, the inheriting party may optionally choose to pay out all outstanding notes' principle balance (plus acrued interest) before the maturity date.
