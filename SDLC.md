0. **ACQUISITION PHASE**
   1. Proposal
    During the initial stage, the project is proposed to the board of directors, whom calculate a quote and proposal agreement, 
		which must be approved by the customer before brought to the planning stage.

        - **Requirements**: The requirements are defined by the customer, which determines the packages selected in the quote parameters.
			* The requirements may be turned into a proposal document, which may be proposed to the Board of Directors
			* The requirements will be detailed where the customer requests customization, and ambigious to reflect indifferent sentiment
			* The requirements may include a "Stakeholder Analysis", wherein the various investors or stakeholders concerns and considerations may be formally considered and resolution proposed.
        - **Quote**: The quote includes a required deposit, total cost of services, and an abstract of the customer's request (with customization details)
			* The quote also includes a revision number, which is incrimented upon each ammendment and revision
			* The quote also includes a projected delivery date, which estimates the date of project completion
			* The projected delivery date is followed by a disclaimer which states that the projected delivery date can be adjusted, but the customer will be notified if any adjustment is made during project development
        - **Service Agreement**: Once/If the quote is accepted by the customer, the Board will draft up a service agreement, which defines project liabilities, limitations,
					 rules, regulations, defines payment agreement, defines "done", lists/defines all services requested, outlines basic project lifecycle schedule, and 
					 requires the customer to sign an agreement which formally begins the service request pertaining to the project.
            * Once/If the service agreement is signed by the customer, the Board of Directors must sign to approve the project and the service request.
        - **Budget:**: Concurrently with the drafting of the service agreement, the Board will comission a budget to be created, which details available
					 funds for project development expenses, the budget will take into account and be guided by the "quote" delivered and approved by the customer.
            * The budget may not exceed the "quote", as approved by the customer, or else the customer must be notified and approve such increase.
    ## ** Final Deliverable **: Project Manifest Document
      - Requirements
      - Standards & Expectations (w/ "done" defined)
      - Milestones & Deliverables

    2. Planning
        - **Service Request**: Once/If the service request is placed to a project management lead, they are responsible for communicating project goals and objectives
       to project manager(s) they assign to the project. A project may have more than one project manager if it is extensive enough, this decision is to be made
       by the Board, and must be present within the project's budget and also must be approved by the customer if not budgeted.
          * The service request will expand upon the requested services to outline key instructions and other relavant development concerns.
          * Project Roadmap: The service request will require the creation of a project roadmap, which outlines: development objectives, deliverables, and project development milestones.
          * Project Tasks: The development objectives are expanded upon in tasks, which project management assigns to engineer leads (and/or engineers directly).\
