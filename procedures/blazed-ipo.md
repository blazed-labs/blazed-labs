## Introduction
A public stock-offering can be a great way for companies to quickly raise capital. A company may only go public if it is organized as a "C-CORP".

## Scope
These procedures are to be used by Blazed National Citizens who own, or hold an executive role in a Blazed Nation recognized corporation.

## Process
1. The company must hire an investment bank to underwrite the prospectus.
2. Once an investment bank is selected, they will draft up the prospectus for the stock offering.
3. The investment bank must then purchase all of the shares which are to be offered in the IPO.
4. The company may apply to be listed on a public stock exchange, if they wish.
5. The investment bank will be required to file the necessary paperwork with the Office of Finance.
6. The investment bank will create sales listings for their owned shares of the company.
7. Finally, the company is public and its shares can trade on the exchange which hosts it.

## Follow-Up Obligations
The company must:
1. File an "Annual Report" with the Office of Finance, consisting of:
    * Balance Sheet
    * Income Statement
    * Cash Flow Statement
    * Statement of Change in Equity
2. Hold at least 1 shareholder meeting annually.
3. File quarterly "Earnings Report" with the Office of Finance.
