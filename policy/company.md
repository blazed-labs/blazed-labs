## Blazed Software
The Blazed Software website is a software sharing platform with amazing community and feedback features. Also, we employ a strict quality assurance (QA) policy when examining submitted software.

Every time a software project issues a release, a (or many) Blazed Engineer(s) will carefully examine the entire source code of the software for unwanted operations.
