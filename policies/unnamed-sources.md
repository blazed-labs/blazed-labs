## Policy
Blazed Labs LLC and Blazed Publishing recognize the importance of protecting the credibility of their journalism and editorial content. The use of unnamed sources is a delicate issue that must be handled with the utmost care and responsibility.

The following policy outlines the guidelines that Blazed Labs LLC and Blazed Publishing employees must follow when using unnamed sources in their reporting:

1. The use of unnamed sources should be avoided whenever possible. Reporters and editors should make every effort to obtain information from sources who are willing to be identified.

2. When a reporter or editor must use an unnamed source, they must be sure that the source's information is reliable, credible, and significant.

3. Reporters and editors should identify the source's position and proximity to the story. They should explain why the source was granted anonymity and why their perspective is critical to the story.

4. Sources should not be granted anonymity to provide opinions, personal attacks, or speculation. Reporters and editors should verify the information provided by the source before agreeing to grant them anonymity.

5. When using an unnamed source, the reporter or editor should not reveal their identity to anyone outside of the newsroom, except under certain legal circumstances. Additionally, they should not reveal any information that could lead to the identification of the source.

6. The use of unnamed sources should be approved by a senior editor or manager, who will determine whether the source's information is significant enough to justify the use of anonymity.

7. The decision to grant anonymity should be made on a case-by-case basis, and the use of unnamed sources should be minimized whenever possible.

8. Reporters and editors should keep a record of all anonymous sources and their reasons for granting anonymity. This information should be available to senior editors or managers upon request.

9. Blazed Labs LLC and Blazed Publishing reserve the right to publish any information that may identify the source, including in the case of a subpoena or other legal order.

10. The use of unnamed sources is not a substitute for accuracy, and reporters and editors must continue to verify information and provide context to ensure that their reporting is fair, balanced, and credible.
