## Introduction
This is business process documentation, which details the process by which new employees shall be onboarded.

## Scope
These policies are to be used by authorized members of the Blazed Labs LLC company.
This procedure is expected to be invoked whenever a hiring manager at Blazed Labs LLC has 
selected a candidate, conducted all interviews needed, and has chosen one or more applicants to
fill their job openings.  

## Required Documents
Please print out the following documents for the employee to fill out:
(Please organize the documents in this order)
1. Code of Conduct
2. Workplace Health and Safety
3. Attendance Policy
4. Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Policy
5. Employee Handbook
6. Form I-9
7. Form W-4
8. Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)
9. Non-Compete Agreement (NCA)
10. Employment Agreement
11. Equipment Release Form
12. Privacy Policy

## Process
1. Welcome employee to the team, take some time to explain the general attitude, 
amd to go over the Employee Handbook. Employee must read the Handbook completely
before signing the last page.
2. Once the employee has read the Handbook in full, you (the hiring manager) 
and the employee must sign:
* **Page 28** of the Handbook. Instruct employee to retain this page.
* **Page 29** of the Handbook. Collect this copy, submit to HR to file.
3. After signing the Handbook, instruct the employee to fill out forms **I-9 and
W-4**. Collect both forms to submit to HR to file with the IRS.
4. Next, instruct the employee to promise non-disclosure/non-competition of trade and
company secrets, and if they agree, have them sign the **NDA and NCA agreements**.
5. Now that the employee has been cleared, is the point of the formal job offer,
where the employee signs an employee agreement, after negotiating salary, benefits, etc.
with the hiring manager. Upon signing this document, give it to HR so they may file it
under the employee.
6. The employee's employment is now official! congratulate the new hire!
7. Then, ask if they would like a company phone, or to use their own phone for 
company-related business.
8. Create a new Google Workspace account for the employee. 

**(preferred: first.last@blazed.space)**

Allow the employee to log into the new account, assure it works as intended, and then
encourage them to enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), using an app like [Google
Authenticator](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605).

9. Instruct the employee to fill out the Equipment Release Form (which is the 2nd page of
the "Cover"), reflecting the Product ID (found by searching "Product ID" in the 
Windows search bar) of the assigned laptop, the phone number of the assigned phone (if
applicable), and the assigned company email adress. Collect the Release Form, and
submit it to HR to file under the employee.

10. Once that has been completed, the employee is free to begin their role,
to learn, to grow, and to advance science for all of mankind. Encourage the employee
to get comfortable with the workplace duties and expectations, and to tackle an 
introductory project to help acclimate the employee to their new role.
11. If the employee shows interest in a introductory project, go over the New Project
Procedure. Blazed Labs LLC will always approve all introductory projects, so long as 
they maintain am agile footprint and maintain a low budget.
