# Project Policy

## Definition
A project shall be constituted as a collection of actionable tasks, which are carried out in a certain order, such that an anticipated deliverable is realized or produced. Project Management shall be defined as: the "application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities in order to meet or exceed stakeholder needs and expectations" [Source](https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/stakeholder-analysis-pivotal-practice-projects-8905).

## Project Lifecycle

### Instantiation
All projects must begin as a proposal, which must be approved by at least one superior (senior) employee/contributor.
However, most projects will need 

more than just two backers to get cleared for any substantial funding.

Only employees and open-source contributors may propose projects before the Blazed Development Group.

* **Please Note:** Proposing a project before the Blazed Development Group is not free. The Blazed National Government charges B$500 for every project proposal, whether it is accepted or denied.
* Please use the [Project Proposal template](https://github.com/blazed-labs/blazed-labs/blob/main/templates/new-project.md) to format your proposal.

### The "Road Show"
Before it can even dream of being adopted by the Blazed Development Group, a Project must be showed to investors in what's called the "Road Show". The more backers sponsor the Project, the more likely it is to be adopted.

### Acceptance
If the Blazed Development Group decides to adopt a Project, that means it shows great promise, has a solid business/implementation model, and it has significant community backing. However, the work has not ended: it has only just begun.

### Adoption
The process of Project adoption begins with the Service Agreement Contract. This document turns you (the developer/development team) into the Service Provider, and Blazed Labs LLC becomes the client. The signed contract is to be retained by Blazed Labs LLC until/unless a successful acquisition has occured.

After the Service Agreement has been signed, a formal Project Manifest will be drafted, this document will be more detailed than the project proposal was.

The Project Manifest Document has three essential parts:
1. Requirements
2. Standards & Expectations (w/ "done" defined)
3. Milestones & Deliverables

If needed, the budget may be re-drafted to accommodate changes in the Project's Requirements list.

### Planning
Once the Service Agreement has been signed, the Project officially enters the "Planning" stage, wherein:
   - The Project Roadmap will be constructed
   - The Project's Tasks are drafted
   - The Project Engineering Document will be drafted
   - The Project's Release Schedule will be devised.

During this stage, the initial project proposer will work closely with Blazed Project Management to assure their vision is properly translated to the intended medium.

### Design
When the first draft of the Engineering Document is complete, the Project officially enters the "Design" stage.

During this stage, designers will create mock-ups of the final deliverable. The designers will also work the Software Design Document.

### Development
After the first draft of the Software Design Document has been completed, the Project enters the "Development" stage. If the project "wasn't taking shape" before, just watch as it begins to truly take shape!

### Testing
Once all requirements have been satisfied in the final deliverable, the Project enters the "Testing" stage. Here, we need to put it through the wringer to catch and fix as many bugs as possible before deployment.

### Staging
Depending on the size and scale of the Project, the "Staging" stage may or may not be skipped. However, staging actually serves a purpose, whereas the development team can deal with production-level issues before deployment.

### Deployment
Finally, a delivered Project will be deployed as defined in its Manifest Document.
