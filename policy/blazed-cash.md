# Blazed Cash (B\$) Policy
The official currency of the Blazed Nation is Blazed Cash (B\$). 

## Minting Blazed Cash (B\$)
No one agent or otherwise shall mint Blazed Cash (B\$) other than the Woodrow Central Banking Authority. Blazed Cash (B\$) minted by anyone other than the Woodrow Central Banking Authority will be considered counterfeit. If anyone is found guilty of the production, distribution, or sale of counterfeit Blazed Cash (B\$), they will have their account banned for life, citizenship revoked indefinitely, and all their companies, assets, property, and Blazed Cash (B\$) will be confiscated. 

## Bank Accounts
While individual Blazed Cash (B\$) notes can be "dumped" to a physical file and decentralized, the safest and easiest way to store, send, and receive Blazed Cash (B\$) is with a Checking Account, available from any one of the many friendly banking establishments of the Blazed Nation. A standard checking account allows the agent to store, send (via bank wire), and receive Blazed Cash (B\$).

## Credit and Loans
Agents who maintain a favorable credit history report may be eligible to sign up for a credit line or fixed-term loan from a participating banking establishment operating within the Blazed Nation. The Blazed National Government protects lenders and borrowers from substantial financial loss with subsidies, fee wavers, and substantial debt-forgiveness. Agents can view their credit history report, free of charge, on the Blazed City website.

## Bonds
A company in the Nation of Blazed is eligible to issue bonds, as long as:
1. The company has a favorable credit rating for investors;
2. The company has a stable financial history; and
3. The company promises not to default on repayment; 

A Corporate Bond offering sells notes to investors. These notes have a principal value, an issuer's tag, and a maturity date. During the lifetime of the bond note, the note may be bought and sold by/to other agents. Also during it's lifetime, the interest rate that the bond pays may fluctuate, which offers the potential for greater gains/growth, but brings along a greater risk of loss. Therefore, corporations may choose to include a rate-freeze option on their bond issue. These notes will be protected from interest rate fluctuations. On the maturity date listed on the note, the active owner will receive the principal sum plus interest accrued during the total lifespan of the note.

## Stocks and ETFs
In the virtual micronation of Blazed, we support a variety of public and private stock exchanges. These allow prospective investors to own shares in local Blazed businesses, the company pays dividens of renvenues accrued to shareholders. ETFs are simply collections of one or more stocks combined in one portfolio.

Business owners intending to raise capital for business ventures may benefit from an IPO.

## Sales Listing
Commercial property-owners may create "Sales Listings" for their owned assets. The business-owner simply sets the asking price, and the item is ready to be sold as soon as the prospective buyer sees it. The listing offering will be visible when agents visit the place of business which offers the sale. Companies may also pay to have sales listings featured on other pages.

## Purchase Agreement
Used to mark the mutual and voluntary exchange of Blazed Cash (B\$) for goods or services. After such an exchange has commenced, the merchant must report the sale to the Office of Commerce using the [Purchase Notice](https://forms.gle/T9xBxDSmckgeUJN18) form.

**Note:** The purchase notice does not need to be filed if the sale occured through the Blazed City system (ie. the merchant created a sales listing; the customer purchased directly from that listing). This is because a sales listing will automatically file the form upon successful check out.
