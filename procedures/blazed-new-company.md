## Introduction
All agents recognized by the Blazed Nation are permitted to form a company and conduct business as/on behalf of that company. No business should be conducted unless lawfully employed or the owner of a business.

## Scope
These procedures are to be used by Blazed National Citizens who want to operate their own business.

## Procedure
1. You must have an account on [blazed.city](https://blazed.city/).
2. You must have the necessary funds available to cover the filing fee:
    - LLC: B\$115 (then, B\$50/year)
    - S-CORP: B\$250 (then, B\$100/year)
    - C-CORP: B\$300 (then, B\$150/year)
3. You must choose a unique name for your company, search names of registered companies before choosing a name!
4. Once the funds are secured, your founding members have been round up, and you have chosen an industry to enter, you are ready to fill out the [NewCompany](https://forms.gle/wQmySnSaDt9xmpw78) form. 
5. Once you've submitted the form, wait about 24-48 hours. You will be notified by email when your business has been fully formed. Once it is formed, you will be able to access and manage it from [blazed.city](https://blazed.city/).

## New Company Package
All new companies will be offered the following upon their formation:
- Business Checking Account from Woodrow Central Bank
- Private (BLZ-PRIV) and Public (BLZ-PUB) IDs
- Business Loan/Credit offers from Woodrow Central Bank and other Banks

## Selecting a Headquarters (HQ)
All companies need a main operating address. If one is not selected, it will default to the main residence of the owner. But all great companies outgrow the home-office, and once that occurs the can purchase property either already developed or undeveloped (and orchestrating development of an establishment). Many companies can be headquartered at one location/establishment/address.
