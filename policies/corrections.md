## Policy
Blazed Publishing is committed to publishing accurate and reliable content. However, errors can occur, and it is important to correct them promptly and transparently. The following policy outlines the guidelines that Blazed Publishing employees must follow when making corrections to published content:

1. Corrections should be made as soon as possible after an error is discovered. Corrections may be made to any type of content, including articles, videos, podcasts, and social media posts.

2. All corrections should be clearly labeled as such, using language such as "Correction" or "Update" at the beginning of the article or in a prominent location. The correction should be noted in the same location where the original error appeared.

3. Corrections should be factual and objective. The corrected information should be accurate and relevant to the original content.

4. If the correction is significant, the reason for the error and the correction should be explained. The explanation should be concise and not include personal opinions or speculation.

5. If the error resulted in harm to an individual or organization, a correction should be made promptly and an apology may be appropriate.

6. Corrections to online content should be made to the original content and not simply added as a comment or separate post. If the correction is made to an article that has been syndicated or republished, Blazed Publishing should make every effort to communicate the correction to the other outlets.

7. Corrections should be reviewed and approved by a senior editor or manager before being published.

8. If the error is disputed, Blazed Publishing may choose to add an update to the article to indicate that the correction is under review. In these cases, the update should explain the nature of the dispute and what steps are being taken to resolve it.

9. Blazed Publishing may choose to keep a log of all corrections made, including the nature of the error, the date of the correction, and the names of those involved in making the correction.

10. If a correction involves a legal issue or dispute, Blazed Publishing may seek advice from legal counsel before publishing the correction.

Blazed Publishing recognizes the importance of accuracy in its content and is committed to maintaining the highest standards of journalistic integrity. This corrections policy is designed to ensure that errors are promptly and transparently corrected, and that readers can have confidence in the accuracy of the content we publish.
