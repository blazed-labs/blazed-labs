In such an event, the citizen or company will not be allowed to file any deductibles for that calendar year. Failure to pay accrued taxes will result in legal action after three (3) consecutive years of nonpayment. Citizens or companies who paid in excess of their yearly dues will be reimbursed by a tax return upon filing their annual tax report.

## 2.E Insurance
Citizens and companies may purchase and hold insurance, which provides compensation in the event of an unexpected loss. An insurance policy is offered by a company which also holds an insurance permit. The insurance policy, which the policy holder must agree to, designates a policy premium (monthly cost) as well as a deductible, which is the amount paid in the event that the insurance policy needs to be paid out. Also, the insurance policy contains criteria which designate the terms which must be met to pay out the insurance policy. The insurance company has the right to charge a policy holder based on their history and credit score. Finally, the insurance policy contains the scope to which the policy is effective, and designates the criteria which will cause the agreement to be nullified. The types of insurance are as follows:
* Workers compensation insurance
* General liability insurance (business)
* Deposit insurance (WDIC)
* Lenders insurance (WCIC)
* Bond and/or CD insurance
* Home/renters insurance

## 2.F Wire Transfer
Funds may be transferred directly from one account to another, even if the accounts are held by two different banks. Bank A (the sending party) initiates a wire transfer with a "Request to Transfer Funds", issued to Bank B (the receiving party). Bank B responds with an "ACCEPTANCE" or "DENIAL" based on if the account referenced exists. Upon receiving an "ACCEPTANCE" from Bank B, Bank A will be then required to send the appropriate money to Bank B, and file a "Notice of Financial Transfer" to the Office of Finance. A wire transfer request can also be sent by Bank A to request money from an identified account. Upon "ACCEPTANCE" by the identified account owner, the funds will be sent to Bank A, and Bank B will be responsible for issuing a "Notice of Financial Transfer" to the Office of Finance.

## 2.G Purchase agreement
Citizens and companies may enter into a purchase agreement with a merchant or private seller. Completing such an agreement requires the selling party to file a "Purchase Notice" with the Office of Commerce. Merchants with goods for sale may attach a sales listing to the store of goods, which allows for such purchase agreements to be generated automatically when a user clicks "Buy".

## 2.H Central Banking authority
The Nation of Blazed and the Office of Finance vests its banking authority in the Woodrow Central Bank. The Woodrow Bank has sole authority to print Blazed Cash (B\$), as long as it acts within the budgetary limitations set forth by the Office of Finance. The Woodrow Central Bank shall also issue government based subsidized and unsubsidized loans. Subsidized loans accrue 0% interest over their term. The amount of money offered by loans is also limited by the budget published by the Office of Finance. The Woodrow Central bank is also responsible for writing Real-estate Bonds to raise funds for land development projects. Finally, the Woodrow Central Bank is required to issue a maintenance free checking account to all recognized agents (including bots). The Woodrow Central Bank shall offer all official (permit holding) Banks of the Blazed Nation deposit and bond default insurance from the WDIC (Woodrow Deposit Insurance Corporation). The WDIC insurance shall cover any liable loss of managed funds by the issuing bank (the policy holder). Deposits will be insured up to a limit, as defined in the insurance policy held by the respective bank. Bond default will also be covered by WDIC insurance. If an issuing company cannot repay its issued bonds upon the maturity date, the payments will be covered by the Woodrow Central Bank, and deferred by a government subsidized loan offered to the defaulting company. The Woodrow Central Bank shall offer all official (permit holding) banks of the Blazed Nation lending default insurance from the WCIC (Woodrow Credit Insurance Corporation). The WCIC insurance shall cover the loss of funds to a creditor when a borrower defaults on their loan. If a borrower cannot repay its issued loan(s), the principle amount will be reimbursed by the Woodrow Central Bank. 

## 2.I Bonds
An asset known as a "bond" may be created and offered for sale by an approved company. A bond is divided up into a series of shares, which all have a principle balance, an interest rate, a term (or maturity date), and a rating (A, AA, AAA). The principle balance determines the dividend paid to investors upon the maturity date (plus accrued interest). An interest rate, written in the bond by the issuing company, will determine the variable amount of Blazed Cash (B\$) relative to the principle balance, paid to the owner of the bond upon the maturity date. The term (or maturity date) will denote the period which the bond is to pay its principle balance (plus accrued interest) to the owner of the share (on the date of maturity, after the determined period has passed). Once issued, a company can sell its bonds on the bond market. A buyer of one or more share(s) may also opt to sell their share(s) before the maturity date. To begin issue, a company must have its bond proposal approved by a bank, and must be sponsored by one or more banks. Another bank or agency must rate the proposed bond (A, AA, AAA) based on the issuing company's likelihood to default upon repayment. In the event of default, the Woodrow Central Bank's Default insurance will assure the necessary investors will be compensated.

## 2.J Credit Score
The Credit Reporting Agency of Blazed (CRAB) will store history related to borrowed funds, fund repayment, financial responsibility, length of credit history, purchase/income habits, and net-worth for all Blazed agents. The data collected will be used to generate a credit report and credit score, which rate the overall creditworthiness of the respective agent. Banks, financial institutions, employers, landlords, and educators may use this score to determine if a citizen or company is eligible for a certain offer. Citizens and companies may also submit a request for forgiveness or redaction on any reported statement. Unsettled debts may also be settled by an agreement (negotiation) between the creditor and borrower.

## 2.K Loans
Certain creditors (specifically those who have Banking permits and WDIC insurance) may agree to lend a sum of Blazed Cash (B\$) to a borrower. The loan shall be instantiated by a Loan Agreement, which defines the terms of the loan (principle amount, length/term of repayment, and interest rate). The borrower must agree to the loan agreement before the exchange can occur. Once agreed and approved, the citizen or company who borrowed the funds will be credited the principle (minus tax) to their active checking account. Creditors may conversely offer a line of credit, which will offer a range (up to a predetermined limit) of funds available for use at any time by an approved borrower. A creditor must issue a holding account (checking or savings) which the borrower may send payments to. In the case of credit lines, the holding account may share its account number with the issuing account.

# Authority
The Blazed National constitution has been drafted with adherence to local laws and regulations. The land claimed by this constitution does not impede or infrige upon any existing constitution or treaties, as the Nation of Blazed is organized as a micronation. The Ruff Management Inc. company and Blazed Labs LLC jointly vests their companys' equity into the Blazed Cash (B\$) dollar, as issued (minted) by the Woodrow Central Bank of Blazed.
