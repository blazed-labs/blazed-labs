# Bookkeeping Handbook

## Definitions

- **Account.** An account, within the context of [secured transactions](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/secured_transaction), is defined under [Article 9](https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/9/) of the [Uniform Commercial Code](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/Uniform_Commercial_Code), as a right to payment of a monetary obligation.  Not included:  (1) [letters of credit](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/letter_of_credit), (2) [commercial tort claims](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/commercial_tort_claim), (3) ]deposit accounts](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/deposit_account), (4) [investment property](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/investment_property), (5) [chattel paper](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/chattel_paper), or (6) rights to payment for money or funds that have been [advanced](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/advance) or sold.

- **Accounts Payable.** Short-term debt that a company owes to its suppliers for products received before payment is made. Accounts payable entries are listed under "Current Liabilities" in the business' balance sheet and the items are removed once the account has been paid.
  
- **Accounts receivable.** Accounts receivable (abbreviated A/R) is money owed to a business by another business or individual in exchange for property or services that were provided on credit.  The settlement of an account receivable begins by sending an invoice to the customer.  A company enters accounts receivable under current assets on its balance sheet. For example, a restaurant supply shop sells $10,000 worth of equipment to a restaurant on credit. As soon as the equipment is delivered to the restaurant the business records an account receivable on its books. Once the restaurant makes the full payment (in whatever time frame set out under the terms of the agreement) the accounts receivable is essentially replaced with cash. The case of United States v. Berg is an example of accounts receivables used in a legal setting.
  
- **Accumulated earnings.** Accumulated earnings represent a company's net profit after having distributed dividends to the stockholders. 

- **Accrual Method of Accounting.** Accrual method of accounting is the method used by most large businesses in reporting their liabilities and expected income. The accrual method requires businesses to report all economic transactions, whether liabilities or income “when all the events have occurred which fix the right to receive such income” (Treasury Regs. §1.451-1(a)). The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requires most businesses with income above $25 million to use this method of accounting because it more accurately reflects the current financial status of businesses with very complex  and numerous transactions occurring. Conversely, some businesses also use the cash method of accounting which only reports transactions when they occurred. For example, if ABC Co. signed a sale contract to purchase XYZ Co.’s warehouse but did not pay yet, the accrual method would require ABC Co. to report the transaction because it is likely to occur, but the cash method would not require reporting the transaction until the payment occurred. 

- **Advance.** An advance is a type of loan or payment in which money or goods are given before consideration is received in return; usually with the expectation of repayment or [adjustment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/adjustment) in basis by the party receiving the advance.

Advance payments are generally made in two types of situations: 1) as [security](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/security) for the delivery of goods or services or 2) as an early payment of a bill or debt. 

- **Annual Percentage Rate (APR).** The annual cost of a loan, which includes both interest on the loan, and loan-related fees. This is calculated by multiplying the interest rate per payment period by the number of the number of such payment periods in a year.
  
- **Appreciate.** Appreciate means to increase in value (the opposite of depreciate). It may also mean: to understand or recognize the value or significance of something or someone.
  
- **Appreciation.** Appreciation is an increase in an asset's value, usually due to inflation or other external economic factors (the opposite of depreciation).

- **Asset.** An asset is something of value owned by an individual or organization. An asset can be physical property like a building or [intangible property](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/intangible_property) such as a patent. Assets are an important part of and differ in many areas of law.
  
- **Basis.** Under U.S. tax law, basis is the cost or value of an asset – used to determine equity or ownership for the purpose of tax assessment, exchange, or sale. It generally includes purchase price, taxes, transportation costs, and fees, and is increased or decreased based on what occurs to the property during its owner's period of ownership in order to determine the owner's adjusted basis. 

When the assigned value of a property is based solely on its cost of acquisition, its basis is referred to as cost basis – which is generally the case for most assets. The cost of acquisition may include amounts that are paid by cash, debt obligations, and other property or services. 

In the case of common assets, like [stocks](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/stock) and [bonds](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/bond), basis is generally the purchase price, plus additional costs such as commissions and recording or transfer fees. However, there are cases where the basis of an asset is not determined by the taxpayer's cost of acquisition, but rather by an asset's fair market value or the basis of a previous owner. 

**Book Account.** A business record of a customer's account which indicates the total amount owed by the client at any given time. The book account serves as a clear basis for bringing suit on a customer's failure to repay the debt.

**Book Value.** Book value (also known as [net](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/net) asset value) is a way of measuring a business's value or worth (valuation) using its tangible assets by taking the value of a business's material assets minus its liabilities. Since book value does not include intangible assets, such as goodwill, the resulting book value is often less than the fair value or real value of a business. 

Under general accounting principles, "book value" has a standard definition, namely a company's assets over its liabilities.

- **Bookkeeper.** A Bookkeeper refers to a corporation's or organization's financial record keeper. This person will usually be in charge of keeping records of the company's accounts, expenditures, earnings, profits, losses, receipts, etc. Bookkeepers and Accountants fall under the supervision of the [Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)](https://sec.gov).
  
- **Calendar Year Accounting Period.** Calendar year accounting period is the accounting period that uses the calendar year, which is the common Gregorian calendar, and begins on January 1 and ends on December 31. An accounting period is an established time frame within which accounting functions are performed, summarized, and analyzed for the calculation of all annual financial information such as [income taxes](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/income_tax). The accounting period can usually be a calendar year or a [fiscal year](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fiscal_year_accounting_period).
  
- **Call.** Call generally means to request or to use an [option](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/option). Call has a few different meanings that arise in the legal context:
  * A person "calls" an option when they choose to use a [call option](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/call_option) for buying an asset. The person gets to buy a certain amount of an asset for a certain price after calling the option.
  * A person calls in debt owed to them from someone by requesting payment.
  * The Speaker of the House calls a meeting to order. 

- **Call Option.** A call option (often shortened to call) is a contract that allows its owner to buy an asset or service from the seller at a certain price until a certain date. The buyer never has to purchase the assets, and the option will terminate at the specified date. People pay for call options because they offer chances of profit or safety in price, and a seller benefits if the assets sold fall in price after selling the call option.

- **Cap.** A cap is a set limit on some form of income, interest, fees, loan, or benefit.

- **Capital.** The available assets of a business, including liquid assets (cash) and/or physical assets (machinery, buildings, and equipment).
  
- **Capital Account.** A shareholder's or owner's account indicating the individual owner's investment plus net income from business operations, minus any net losses from operations, and minus any withdrawals of funds by the owner for personal use.
  
- **Capital Asset.** Tangible and generally illiquid property used by a business to generate profit, such as equipment and buildings. The usefulness of the asset is expected to extend beyond one year.
  
- **Capital expenditure.** Capital expenditures (CapEx) are funds used to acquire, upgrade, or maintain capital assets. Capital expenditures are reflected in the [cash flow statement](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/cash_flow_statement), and can be calculated by adding current depreciation with the change in plant, property, and equipment (PP&E) from the previous accounting cycle. The measurement shows how much a business invests in capital assets. 

- **Capital Gains.** Capital gains refers to profits realized from the sale of capital assets. The difference between the original purchase price and the sale price is the gain. Like other forms of income, capital gains are subject to income tax. The tax on capital gains only occurs when an asset is sold or "realized." If the sale price is higher than the original purchase price, then the difference is a capital gain. If the sale price is lower than the original purchase price, then the difference is a capital loss.

There are two categories of capital gains: short-term and long-term. If the asset was held for one year or less, the capital gain is short-term. If the asset was held for more than one year, then the capital gain is long-term.

Different tax rates apply for long- and short-term capital gains. As of [February 11, 2020](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc409), the tax rate on most net capital gain is 15% for most individuals. Net capital gain is calculated from deducting capital losses from the total of capital gains.

- **Capital Investment.** Capital investments can refer to a business's acquisition of a capital asset or a type of loan by a financial institution in a business. In the latter, a financial institution, commonly a venture capital group, loans a business money in exchange for a promise of repayment or a share of the profits. 
  
- **Capital Stock.** Capital stock, also known as authorized stock, refers to all common stock and preferred stock a corporation is legally allowed to issue. A corporation’s charter establishes the amount of shares the corporation may issue, and the board of directors can either issue the maximum amount or retain a portion of the shares. Corporations record capital stock in the equity section on their balance sheets. The amount of capital stock issuable by a company can be changed, but the process requires amending the corporate charter, usually involving difficult, expensive shareholder voting. 

- **Capitalized Expenditure.** As opposed to an ordinary (or operating expense), which covers the day-to-day costs necessary to keep a business running, a capitalized expenditure is an expense that is made to 1) acquire an asset (whether [tangible](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/tangible_personal_property) or [intangible](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/intangible_property)) that has a useful life longer than a year or 2) improve the useful life of an existing capital asset (like property, plants, buildings, technology and equipment). Such expenses are recorded, or capitalized, on a company’s [balance sheet](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/balance_sheet) as an investment, whereas ordinary expenses are expensed on a company’s [income statement](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/income_statement) and deducted fully in the year the expense is incurred. [Capitalization](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/capitalization) requires that a company spread the cost of a capitalized expenditure over the useful life of the asset. 
  
- **Capitalized Value.** Capitalized value is the current worth of an asset, usually real estate, based on a calculation of expected income from the asset over the course of its economic lifespan. Capitalized value is a useful tool for investors to decide whether an asset is a good investment. Normally, capitalized value is estimated by dividing the expected yearly income by the [capitalization rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalizationrate.asp) and reducing the sum by a discount rate in order to accurately reflect the present value. The discount rate is needed because the calculation shows future income, and under the time value of money concept, future money is worth less in current money because of inflation and missed interest opportunity. The discount rate is calculated using different methods but usually is determined based on the foregone interest the money could have accrued in other investments. 

- **Cash Method of Accounting.** Cash method of accounting is a method of accounting used by many individuals and some small businesses to record their liabilities and income. When using the cash method, transactions are recorded only when the payments have been made or received. This is to be contrasted with the accrual method of accounting which records transactions as soon as a debt or income has been achieved, meaning the payment may not have been made yet. The cash method is easier to use because recording only has to be made when the actual financial payments are made. However, the cash method does not reflect obligations yet to be paid, and therefore, the cash method can be misleading regarding the state of the business. The [Internal Revenue Service (IRS)](https://irs.gov/) requires most large businesses and some individuals to use the accrual method because of these flaws. 
  
- **Cashier's Check.** A cashier’s check is a bill of exchange, drawn by a bank upon itself (the bank is the [debtor](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/debtor)), payable to another person, showing the [payee’s](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/payee) authorization to receive the amount represented on the check from the bank.
  
- **Certificate of Deposit (CD)** Certificate of deposit (CD) is a savings account that holds a fixed amount of money for a fixed period of time and during that time, the account accrues [interest](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/interest), which the issuing bank pays out. The lump sum deposited must be in the account for the allotted time, which is predetermined when deposited. The interest rate is dependent on the bank’s savings and money market product, and the penalties that apply for a premature withdrawal. 
  
- **Certified Check.** Certified check is a type of [check](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/check) that guarantees that there will be enough funds available for the recipient by the issuing bank. Additionally, the bank also verifies that the signature on the check is genuine. Certified checks are used to increase confidence that the creditworthiness of the account holder is legitimate and so the check does not bounce. In larger transactions, it may be difficult to pay with cash, so a certified check can be used to secure the amount compared to a personal check, which may bounce.
  
- **Chapter 7 Bankruptcy.** When a debtor becomes insolvent and the bankruptcy proceeding begins, the debtor will either liquidate its assets or reorganize its debts. The liquidation route is governed by Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.

In a liquidation, the assets of the debtor, usually a corporation, are sold in piecemeal or as a going concern “in order to satisfy the debtor(’s) creditors.” See In Re Cohen, 141 B.R. 1 (Bankr. D. Mass. 1992). 

Under the Code, a trustee administers the liquidation by “marshalling all available property, reducing it to money, distributing it to creditors, and closing up the estate.” (In Re Midway Airlines, Inc., 154 B.R. 248 (N.D. Ill. 1993)). The sale of the debtor’s assets creates proceeds that are divided among interest holders in the debtor. The division of proceeds is made according to the hierarchy of the claimants’ rights. 
  
- **Chapter 11 Bankruptcy.** Chapter 11 bankruptcy is the formal process that allows [debtors](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/debtor) and [creditors](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/creditor) to resolve the problem of the debtor’s financial shortcomings through a reorganization plan; see Tamir v. United States Trustee. Accordingly, the central goal of chapter 11 is to create a viable economic entity by reorganizing the debtor’s debt structure. Unlike chapter 7, chapter 11 is not a liquidation of the debtor’s assets. Rather, it is a reorganization of existing assets, principally as debt. The confirmed chapter 11 plan becomes a contract between the debtor and creditors, governing their rights and obligations; see In re Nylon Net Company. 

- **Chapter 13 bankruptcy.** In general, insolvent individuals have the choice of either a chapter 7 or chapter 13 bankruptcy, each governed by the United States Bankruptcy Code. Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code is titled "Adjustment of Debts of an Individual with Regular Income" and, if available to the debtor, comes with several advantages for the debtor and creditors. As a matter of public policy, chapter 13 reflects Congress’ legislative intent to promote, without mandating, over-leveraged individual debtors to use repayment plans to achieve debtor relief and creditor recoveries.
  
- **Charity.** A charity is a [nonprofit organization](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/non-profit_organizations) whose efforts are focused on aiding those in need. This can take several forms, which can be local or international in scope. Some raise money or provide services like food, clothing, or shelter to underprivileged communities. Others promote the welfare of animals through research, shelters, rehabilitation, or conservation efforts. Others still might focus on environmental issues, public health, education, community development, or the arts, though this list is not exhaustive. Charities can be religious or secular in nature. In any case, all charities are tax-exempt in the United States under the [Internal Revenue Code](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/internal_revenue_code_(irc)) section [501(c)(3)](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/exemption-requirements-501c3-organizations). 

- **Chart of Accounts.** A chart of accounts (COA) is a list of all the financial accounts identified in the general ledger of any business. In other words, COAs list all the accounts involved in the company’s day-to-day operations. The COA is used to locate any financial transaction performed by the company. Although each company may have different looking COAs, commonly, they identify account types like revenue, expenses, assets, liabilities, and equity. COAs typically contain a name, a brief description, and an identification code for each account. In any case, though COAs may vary in form, they must comply with the guidelines set out by the [generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/gaap).
  
- **Collateral.** Collateral is an item of value, such as property or assets, that is pledged by an individual (borrower) in order to guaranty a loan. Upon default, the collateral becomes subject to seizure by the lender and may be sold to satisfy the debt. The value of collateral is not based on the market value. It is discounted to take into account the value that would be lost if the assets had to be liquidated in order to pay off the loan.

- **Common Stock.** Common stock is a class of stock that represents equity ownership in a corporation. Owners of common stock, called shareholders, are entitled to the following rights:
  * Voting rights to elect the members of the board of directors. Typically, shareholders may cast one vote per share. However, shareholders may establish deviations from this one-vote-per-share default rule in the corporation’s charter.
  * A residual claim on the corporation’s assets and income in the form of dividends. Although shareholders that own common stock are not entitled to receive a periodic payment of dividends, they are entitled to collect them when the corporation’s board of directors declares its payment.
  * In the event of liquidation of the corporation, shareholders may have rights to the corporation’s remaining assets, provided that the creditors and owners of preferred stock are repaid first.

- **Compound Interest.** Compound interest refers to interest earned on prior interest from an investment. This occurs where an investor continuously earns interest on an outstanding debt owed to them or an investment compounds in value. This is in contrast to simple interest where an investor receives the same amount of interest at every interval. Compound interest is a foundational part of modern-day financing and trading.
  
- **Credit.** In the accounting context, it is the entry on the right-hand side of the balance sheet. Credit can decrease the value of an asset or it can increase the amount of capital, liability or revenue. It is a form of debt.

- **Deficit.** Deficit broadly refers to a person or entity having more expenses than revenue. Typically deficit is used to refer to finances of a company or government where the entity is spending more money than it makes, having to borrow money to cover the deficit. Deficit, though, can refer to non-monetary items as well. Deficit is used in a variety of circumstances as a gauge of the performance, debt load, and financial safety of corporations and governments. 
  
- **Depreciate.** To depreciate, in accounting, is to reduce the value of an asset in accordance with age, wear, or technological relevance. 
  
- **Double-entry Accounting.** A fundamental accounting concept where every transaction or event affects at least two different accounts. In modern day accounting and bookkeeping, the double-entry accounting system is expressed as (Assets = Liabilities + Equity).
  
- **Earned Surplus.** Also known as retained earnings, it is the portion of the profit that the company retains in order to reinvest in the business or repay debt.

- **Entry.** A record of a financial transaction in the appropriate accounting ledger.
  
- **Expense.** A cost incurred by a company through its operations to earn revenue.
  
- **FIFO Accounting.** First in, first out accounting.  A method for assessing the value of inventory, in which the earliest purchased items are assumed to be the first ones sold.  FIFO accounting typically increases the recorded value of inventory; this may lead to higher income taxes, but also helps new businesses get loans on better terms.
  
- **Financial Institution Fraud.** Financial Institution Fraud (FIF) involves fraud or embezzlement occurring within or against financial institutions that are insured or regulated by the U.S. Government.  Financial institutions are threatened by a wide array of frauds, including commercial loan fraud, check fraud, counterfeit negotiable instruments, mortgage fraud, check kiting, false applications, and a variety of traditional and non-traditional FIF scams.
  
- **Fiscal Year Accounting Period.** Fiscal year accounting period is defined as a period of 12 months that a company uses for its accounting purposes; for example, reporting its spending and income. It helps in preparation of company financial statements. It is measured by the first day of the month through the last day of the twelfth month.
  
- **Fixed Asset.** Also known as plant, it is tangible, long-term assets or properties that are not consumed or easily converted into cash. Fixed assets are often used in the production of income.

- **Futures Contract.** A contract between two parties for the purchase of a specified commodity at a future date.
  
- **General Journal.** Where double-entry bookkeeping entries are first recorded as they occur in time. It serves as an aid for transferring the entries later to official accounting records.
  
- **General Ledger.** The formal and main accounting ledger of a company which contains all of the business' financial accounts and statements.
  
- **Goodwill.** The good reputation or brand identification enjoyed by a commercial entity. In bankruptcy and other areas of law, goodwill is considered an intangible asset.
  
- **Gross Income.** The total income of an individual or business from all sources, before subtracting adjustments, exemptions, or deductions allowed by tax law.
  
- **Income.** Income is money or value that an individual or business entity receives in exchange for providing a good or service or through investing capital.

- **Income Statement.** A business' financial statement that measures its revenue performance over the course of a specific accounting period.
  
- **Liquid Asset.** Liquid assets refer to cash on hand, cash on bank deposit, and assets that can be quickly and easily converted to cash. The common liquid assets are stock, bonds, certificates of deposit, or shares.
  
- **Margin.** Margin, or profit margin, is the difference between a product or service’s selling price and the cost of production.
  
- **Net Earnings.** Net earnings, also called net income, is the gross earnings minus mandatory withholdings and deductions, such as state and federal income tax and social security contributions.
  
- **Net Operating Loss (NOL)** A net operating loss occurs when a company’s deductions exceed their gross income for a given year. The [Internal Revenue Code](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/internal_revenue_code) [§ 172(c)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/172#c) defines net operating loss as “the excess of the deductions allowed by this chapter over the gross income.” [§ 172(b)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/172) allows taxpayers to carryback and carryover the net operating loss amount as a deduction to offset their tax liability in those other periods. However, [172(a)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/172) limits the deduction to 80% of taxable income.
  
- **Payable.** “Payable” is a descriptive term denoting a sum of money that may, can, is to be, or should be paid. The meaning depends on the context and jurisdiction. The term frequently appears in insurance, bills, and bankruptcy proceedings.

- **Profit.** The positive gain from an investment after subtracting all expenses.
  
- **Profit and Loss Statement.** Also known as P&L. A financial statement showing a business’s gross income and expenses, used to determine the net profit or loss for a specific period.
  
- **Sarbanes-Oxley Act.** The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) is a federal act passed in 2002 with bipartisan congressional support to improve auditing and public disclosure in response to several accounting scandals in the early-2000s. The act was named after the bill sponsors, Senator Paul Sarbanes and Representative Michael Oxley, and is also commonly referred to as SOX. Find the statutory text here: [Pub.L. 107–204](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PLAW-107publ204/html/PLAW-107publ204.htm).
  
- **Single-entry accounting.** Single-entry accounting is a method of tracking business assets, liabilities, income, and expenses which records each transaction a single time. Also referred to as single-entry bookkeeping.
  
- **Straight-line Depreciation.** When a taxpayer acquires an asset, which is used for business purposes for a period of time, the Tax Code allows the company to deduct the cost of the asset over the consuming period, instead of deducting the cost at the purchasing time. This deduction over a period of time is called depreciation. The straight-line depreciation method is a type of tax depreciation that an asset owner can elect to deduct the cost of the asset over the property’s useful life evenly. By dividing the difference between an asset’s cost and its expected salvage value by the number of years the asset is expected to be used, the asset owner can get the amount of the depreciation each year.
